* Accessible

  * Will be checked against principles we’ve already covered in class.

    * Provide complete information.

    * The bio should help your classmates connect with you if you have interests in accessibility that could work together for your team project.

  * A recognizable picture of your face that people in the class could use to identify you in the real world.

  * Must smoothly provide a link to the [Web Page Bio Links](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10nTEkUx4IVWT_oC9CfM5BCgIWGQVcWJRhelf6fSZpuw/edit?tab=t.0) page.
